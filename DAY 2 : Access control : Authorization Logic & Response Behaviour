OBJECTIVE :
Observe how web applications enforce authorization after authentication by analyzing response behaviour and access restrictions.
ENVIRONMENT:
- web application with authenticated and unauthenticated routes
- practice performed using Portswigger web security academy labs
OBSERVATION:
-Authentication does not guarantee authorization
-Restricted endpoints returned ;
*404 NOT FOUND (international concealment)
* 302 redirect (access flow control)
- No direct error messages exposed to the user.
KEY TAKEAWAYS:
* Access control failures are often silent 
*Status codes can indicate security logic,not succcess or failure
*Observation comes before exploitation
SKILLS PRACTICED:
* Authorization testing
* Response analysis
* Security reasoning
